    			<p>Today I managed to get the cameras working fully, they now update every 8 seconds. Between all the pan/tilt controls is a preview of the robot's view of the surroundings. At the bottom of the screen is another set of views. Each one is from the same camera but in different "wavelengths", a different view in red, green and blue is shown alongside eachother.</p>
    			<p>The servo mechanism has been redesigned and calibrated to work of the controls as I accidentally caught the camera mast on the top of my car when I drove it in after testing.</p>
    			<p>I was going to add the picture representation of the IMU data today, but I couldn't get a reliable value from the IMU, therefore I used the same algorithm as the ultrasonics to create a median average of the data in order to make the data more reliable. This will be my task for tomorrow along with adding more unit tests to code.</p>

    			<p>Today I spent a lot of time testing the rover, so far I found that the left button caused the rover to right and vice versa, this was quickly resolved by switching the parameters around. Unfortunately the batteries ran flat before I had a chance to test out any more code as the last time it was running about, was the mid-term demo 3-4 weeks ago. I still have the picture IMU representation to test the autonomous demo.</p>
				<p>Tomorrow I will implement these last requirements, focussing mainly on the IMU data.</p>
				<p>I have also been working on the abstract, background and analysis section of the report, this will be published to this website once I have finished the first section.</p>

    			<p>Today was spent mainly debugging the code, this includes fixing the command transmission time for simulating the gap in communication between Earth and the rover. I have also been working on the autonomous demo, this will need to be tested tomorrow to ensure everything is working. I also have to get the camera changing colours to simulate the filter wheel on PanCam. I will then have all my technical work done apart from adding some more comments and unit tests.</p>

    			<p>Today I managed to get the camera updating via the user interface every 8 seconds, I would like to be able to add filters to the camera display to emulate the colour wheel on PanCam, this will be a secondary requirement once I finish the unit tests.</p>
				<p>I have started working on Laurence's suggestion of an autonomous demo, the button has been implemented under the obstacle detection, the PHP logic is now communicating the command to get the Arduino to start the sequence. The Arduino will control the autonomous behaviour as the response time is much faster than communicating back to PHP. This is currently a work in progress.</p>
				<p>I also need to record the tilt and yaw of the rover to display the pictures of the rover going up or down hill or tilting to the side, when the rover is driving around. I have the option of using HTML5 canvas to rotate the images. However, I will just use multiple images as it is much easier and send the image location through AJAX to refresh the image.</p>
				<p>The final requirements left are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Demo Autonomous Behaviour</li>
					<li>Display rover tilt and yaw using pictures, not raw values</li>
					<li>Implement more unit tests and comments</li>
				</ol>
				<p>A lot of testing has been done to ensure that all the components and part of the user interface with communication is working, the bugs I found were:
				<ul>
					<li>The servo tilt up has a mind of its own</li>
					<li>The transmission communication delay time only works for a selection of motors</li>
					<li>Autonomous demo (Work in Progress)</li>

Driving and obstacle detection state (state 1) and interactive state (state 2), where the ultrasonic, temperature, humidity, battery voltage, rock samples are shown via the user interface. I currently have the IMU to program and return values, as well as the camera link and autonomous demo to implement. This should be finished by Sunday 8th April 2018 apart from tidying code and implementing further unit tests.</p>
    			<p>I have also been planning and working on the final report, so I can follow the structure over the next 3-4 weeks. Updates on the report will be appearing on the blog next week (9th April 2018).</p>

    			<h2>Successful Testing</h2>
    			<p>This last week of code I have been working on was put to the test today. And everything worked just about first time, after some mistakes of not commenting out debug lines.</p>
    			<p>The live sensor data from all ultrasonics, temperature, humidity and rfid(with rocky type and minerology) are now displayed on the user interface. I have the camera view, IMU and voltage sensor left to programme on the Arduino side, along with a autonomous demo. Then all will be finished!</p>
    			<p>Unfortunately the rover has not been driving since the mid-project demo, therefore the batteries are dead and are on charge. I will test both sensors and driving together tomorrow to make sure none of the process interfere with one another.</p>

    			<p>Today was awesome and managed to glue all the code together, bearing in mind I've had family over today. </p>
    			<p>Since the last blog entry AJAX is now fixed</p>
    			<p>As it stands, I now have the following process working</p>
    			<ol>
    				<li>HTML5, Javascript request through AJAX</li>
    				<li>AJAX request to PHP</li>
    				<li>PHP executes the C file with the command './serial getData 0 > log.txt 2>error.txt'</li>
    				<li>C file pipes output to the log file</li>
    				<li>PHP reads the file and turns it to one long string variable</li>
    				<li>PHP then "explodes" the string using a semi colon to seperate the sensors and values.</li>
    				<li>PHP then creates to substrings one with the sensor name, the other with the sensor value, this is seperated by a colon.</li>
    				<li>More filtering and processing is done in PHP.</li>
    				<li>PHP sends the sensor data as an array using AJAX</li>
    				<li>Javascript receives the array using AJAX and appends the sensor value to the corresponding position in the user interface as document IDs</li>
    				<li>Sensors update every 8 seconds on the user interface</li>
    			</ol>
    			<p>I currently have the following sensors implemented in the user interface</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Ultrasonics</li>
    				<li>RFID and rock samples</li>
    				<li>Temperature Humidity</li>
    				<li>Battery Voltage</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>The sensors left are the camera with filters, correct Battery voltage and IMU data, as well as a demo button for autonomous control recommended by Laurence.</p>
    			<p>Tomorrow I will be working on the Arduino code to make sure all sensors are returning the correct values i.e. IMU and voltage.<br />
    			After that I will be working on the camera and colour filters.</p>

    			<p>This afternoon I hit another milestone, I can now successfully transfer data from the executable C file to output to a txt file, which is the read by PHP. It arrives in PHP as a long string, I then use the function 'explode' which seperates the string into arrays using the semi colon as a character to seperate everything. Each 'exploded' position in the array is then put into two substrings using the 'substr' function. This creates the value 'sensor' and 'sensorvalue'</p>

    				I have started to design an algorithm which is split into 3 different parts.<br />
    				<code>sensor:value;</code> the algorithm takes the first character of the string or from the last separator, to the colon which then creates a substring. From the colon to the semi colon will be another substring to store the value of the sensor. Once we have the value substring we need to cast the data to a numerical value instead of a string by 'casting'.<br />
    			This process will take place every time the sensors are updated on the user interface.</p>

    			<h2>Transmitting and Receiving Serial Data</h2>
    			<p>This afternoon I managed to be able to receive reasonably reliable data over serial and display it to a test page. Now I have code that will transmit and receive data between the Arduino and PHP, I can now work on the PHP serial event detection, to reliably receive data from the Arduino without having to use Javascript intervals on the chance it picks up something on the serial line.</p>
    			<p>I will update the blog later on tonight once I've decided how the communication will have to be altered, the likelihood is that all the sensor data will have to be combined into one big string and then dissected at the other end, rather than many small strings. As for data requests, I'm going to experiment with transmitting all sensor data from the Arduino for PHP to dissect, allowing for just motor and relay signals to be transmitted from PHP, resulting in a much more reliable (and quieter) serial line.</p>
    			<p>Tonight I have backed up the Raspberry Pi SD card as I want to transfer all the data to a EMMC chip as a lot of read and writing is happening, I don't want to 'brick' the SD card in the Pi.<br />
    				I have also decided how the Arduino is going to send the data to the PHP script. This can be seen below:<br />
    				<code>ultrasonic1:val;ultrasonic2:val;ultrasonic3:val;ultrasonic4:val;ultrasonic5:val;ultrasonic6:val;temperature:val;humidity:val;rfid:val;imux:val;imuy:val;imuz:val;battery:val;</code></p>

    				<p>Now that my PhD application has been submitted, I can focus on the server-side software for the robot. This involves the PHP language for detecting strings of data on the Raspberry Pi serial line /dev/ttyACM0.<br />
    				Today I have achieved transmitting commands to the Arduino via PHP, you may notice the time spent to do this one task. I have found that PHP is brilliant for server-side processing and database access etc. But if you add a hardware element, the serial timing becomes a nightmare to manage. The communication becomes slow, unpredictable, which means I may need to redesign the software to conform with the delay involved.</p>
    				<p>At this point, I now see why there is so little documentation on serial communication with PHP - it's a nightmare to detect events on the serial line and be able to send a command and reliably return a value.</p>

								<p>Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it to the tutorial today as I had to sign for a delivery at home, however I wired up and distributed the power to the ultrasonics ready for testing during the weekend</p>
								<p>The delivery I was expecting is a new server for virtualising all the services I'm running for business, web sites. My current GIT server will be virtualised onto the new server this weekend which should greatly increase performance and work flow.</p>

								<h2>Outline Project Specification and GIT Server</h2>
								<p>Today I had a lecture for the major project where Neil gave an example of a outline project specification, this included areas which I had not thought of adding such as the agile methodology and version control. As well as some detail on the upcoming deliverables i.e. the mid term demo and the end of project demo.</p>
								<p>On a side note, due to the intermittent problems with my second hand, refurbished Git server, I have purchased a more powerful new server to replace the existing one by running virtualisation using Ubuntu Server OS. It has truly been a workhorse for the last 4 years, but it's time to retire it.</p>

								<h2>Outline Project Specification, Kanboard and GIT Server</h2>
								<p>This morning I looked over my project specification and changed a lot of the grammar along with the structure. I then asked my dad to suggest improvements. I have now completed the specification and have changed the status to 0.2 review, this is so I can ask Helen to proof read and suggest improvements.<br />
									I have also added more columns to the <a href="kanboard" target="new">Kanboard</a> for planning and testing/reviewing.<br />
								On a side note, the server I have been using GIT for several years is starting to break down and throw errors, therefore I am currently looking for a new server to transfer all my version controlled work for the last 3 years. This will hopefully be sorted this week.</p>

								<p>This evening I started working on the outline project specification and getting the main points needed down. I will carry on working on it tomorrow as I have most likely forgotten something. I'll also get my dad to look over it as a second opinion on grammar etc.</p>

								<h2>Tutorial</h2>
								<p>Today I had my first tutorial for the Major project where we, in turn, introduced ourselves and explained our projects. As this is the first week we didn't have much to talk about. I forgot to mention the functionality as a research rover, being able to use the camera and the rock sampler with RFID. However, I would like to leave these surprises until I have a functioning system in place to show.</p>
								<p>The priority for now is to write up and submit the Outline Project Specification, which I could build upon from my project proposal.</p>
								<p>This weekend I intend to complete the specification and add the draft functionality to <a href="kanboard/" target="new">Kanboard</a>, this is so I can start planning and prioritising what needs to be done first in an 'Agile' fashion.</p>

								<h2>Agile Methodologies</h2>
								<p>Tonight I have spent some time trying to decide what type of Agile Methodology would be suitable for my Major Project. I have also spent some time trying out different open source software for managing tasks and time.</p>
								<h3>Kanban is based on three principles:</h3>
								<ol>
									<li><em>Visualize what you do today (workflow):</em> seeing all the items in context of each other can be very informative</li>
									<li><em>Limit the amount of work in progress (WIP):</em> this helps balance the flow-based approach so teams don't start and commit to too much work at once</li>
									<li><em>Enhance flow:</em> when something is finished, the next highest thing from the backlog is pulled into play</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>What makes Kanban a suitable methodology for my project?</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>No prescribed roles</li>
									<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
									<li>Work is pulled through the system (single piece flow)</li>
									<li>Changes can be made at any time</li>
									<li>Cycle time</li>
									<li>More appropriate in operational environments with a high degree of variability in priority</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>The benefits of using Kanban are:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Shorter cycle times can deliver features faster.</li>
									<li>Responsiveness to Change:</li>
									<li>When priorities change very frequently, Kanban is ideal.</li>
									<li>Balancing demand against throughput guarantees that most the customer-centric features are always being worked.</li>
									<li>Requires fewer organization / room set-up changes to get started</li>
									<li>Reducing waste and removing activities that don't add value to the team/department/organization</li>
									<li>Rapid feedback loops improve the chances of more motivated, empowered and higher-performing team members</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Information on Kanban at <a href="https://www.versionone.com/what-is-kanban/" target="new">https://www.versionone.com/what-is-kanban/</a><br />
									A rather useful download on kanban can be found <a href="https://www.versionone.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Kanban_Agile_Teams.pdf" target="new">here</a></p>
									<h3>Problems I may encounter along the way with Kanban:</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Sticking to the WIP limit</li>
										<ul>
											<li>The difficulty of a task underestimated (overshoot the WIP limit)</li>
											<li>Changes to the way the software works (eating into WIP cycle)</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>
									<h3>Kanban Board</h3>
									I have attempted to install an open source software which manages the Kanban board, this is web browser enabled. I will hopefully link it to the outside-world once I have managed to get a reverse proxy server working.

									<h2>Meetings and Lectures</h2>
									<p>Today I had my first lecture giving an introduction to the Major/Minor Project. Followed by a meeting with my supervisor Dr Helen Miles; we discussed the planning of the project including use of Agile Methodologies (potentially FFD) and using it to plan out the workload. I then set up an account for Helen to access my blog.</p>
